Frontend:

Running locally:
- clone the repo
- navigate to root directory
- `sbt run`
- hit localhost:9000

Some people say that functional programming is slow. This app demonstrates that they are bulshitting.

Parallelism is a piece of cake when programs are expressions which can be composed and manipulated like normal strings and integers.

The app aggregates all the contributors for a certain GitHub organization and sorts them by their contributions.

The parallelism is only limited by the restrictions GitHub REST API.

However since `cats-effect` Runtime works on `Fiber`-s, it's inexpensive to abuse them ðŸ˜„

You are welcome to improve the implementation.

`curl localhost:9000/org/{org_name}` will yield sorted JSON response which looks like:
```json
{
  "count": 3,
  "contributors": [
    {
      "login": "user1",
      "contributions": 5000
    },
    {
      "login": "user2",
      "contributions": 2500
    },
    {
      "login": "user3",
      "contributions": 1000
    }
  ]
}
```
